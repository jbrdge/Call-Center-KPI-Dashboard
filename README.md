# Analysis
- Highest call rate occurs on Monday
- Dan, Diane, and Joe have lowest resolution rates
- Dan and Joe have lowest amount of resolved calls
- Greg, Joe and Martha have the longest call lengths
- Martha had highest resolution rates, but nearly the greatest call lengths. However, she still ha the most resolved calls so call length does not appear to be hurting her number of resolved calls compared to the rest.
